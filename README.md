# methodRec
This repository contains the source code of the method recommendation using LSTM based RNN.


The code contains a method reccomendation system that can predict api method name. The code is written using deeplearning4j library. 

Long Short Term Memory and Reccurent Neural Network is used for getting the method name.

dataset folder contains the dataset we used for the experiment.
